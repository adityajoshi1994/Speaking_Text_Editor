# Speaking_Text_Editor
The speaking text editor uses the internal API's of the cocoa framework for the text to speech functionality.
In particular it uses the NSSpeechSynthesizer class in the framework. The UI is extremly simple and easy to use. 
You can save/load a file for later use and open it using the speaking text editor. It is a very good project to 
start your journey into swift programming.
